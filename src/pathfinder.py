    SearchTreeNodes contain the following attributes to be used in generation of
    the Search tree:

    Attributes:
        player_loc (tuple[int, int]):
            The player's location in this node.
        action (str):
            The action taken to reach this node from its parent (or empty if the root).
        parent (Optional[SearchTreeNode]):

    The main workhorse method of the package that performs A* graph search to find the optimal
    sequence of actions that takes the agent from its initial state and shoots all targets in
    the given MazeProblem's maze, or determines that the problem is unsolvable.

    Parameters:
        problem (MazeProblem):
            The MazeProblem object constructed on the maze that is to be solved or determined
            unsolvable by this method.

    Returns:
        Optional[list[str]]:
            A solution to the problem: a sequence of actions leading from the 
            initial state to the goal (a maze with all targets destroyed). If no such solution is
            possible, returns None.
